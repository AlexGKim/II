We thank the referee for the careful reading and comments, which has led to a revisioned version that is more precise, clear, and realistic.  The revised version takes into account all comments, except for two points where we think were already addressed in the original version.  Changes in the new version are color coded.  We enclose the full referee report with our responses inline.

Before submission of the article to PRD, we shared the manuscript with several experts.  We alert the referee that a late response has led to new text addressing the following topics, which appear in color in the revised manuscript.

- Expanded motivation for II versus other techniques.

- Use of multi-wavelength data.

- Supernova explosion information encoded in the SiII feature.


------ Original Report With Inline Responses --------


This is a well-written paper that explores the potential of intensity
interferometry measurements of type Ia supernovae.

My main concern is that there are a number of factors concerning observations
with the hypothetical telescope array that are not taken into account, such that
the results are far too idealised to be realistic.

Achieving detection of magnitude 12 systems is quite optimistic and relies on
fast (pico-second) timing. Even if picosecond timing photodetectors are used,
the MST mirror dishes are not isochronous and would introduce an intrinsic
timing spread of a few nanoseconds. This is not mentioned here or in Dalal et al
but should be commented on.

Similarly, 'perfect throughput' is assumed, but in reality the mirrors are only
~80% reflective at installation and degrade over time, whilst the photo detector
itself is also not perfect. This will increase the required exposure time.

In practise, a filter installed to measure at a specific wavelength will also
have a certain width, that may smear the signal for a specific wavelength
compared to your results in e.g. figures 4 and 6.

Note also that long wavelength optical light (>~650 nm) is not reflected by
mirrors designed for Cherenkov telescopes, such that the 8750 Angstrom
wavelength would certainly not be measurable.

Lastly, ground-based detectors have limited visibility and cannot observe all
type Ia supernovae that occur anywhere on the sky throughout the year, such that
the expected rate of observable SNe should be further reduced accordingly.

The study should address these points more quantitatively to obtain a more
realistic estimate of the capabilities of a "CTA-MST-array", or else consider
instead the properties of a different set of optical telescopes, better suited
to the measurement.


####

The referee points out that are calculations are idealized and neglect important factors.  The referee highlights deficiencies specific to the CTA-MST array.  Here we go over how we address several points.

- We take the referee's suggestion to consider properties of a better suited telescope: we change our baseline specifications to Keck, adopting an effective aperture 9.96m, mirror reflectivity 0.73, bandpass throughput of 0.9, 0.6 SPAD QE.  The timing dispersion of Keck is much less than 1 ps.

- We expanded discussion in the conclusions on why Cherenkov telescopes are not suited for our science case.

- We add text addressing the question of bandwidth, which indeed was missing in the original manuscript.  To summarize: The noise is detector jitter dominated for bandwidth Delta nu 30 ps Delta nu >> 1.  At optical wavelengths, this corresponds to R<<7000.  Adopting a resolution of R~1000 will not significantly smear the signal.

- Add text to point out limited access from a single observatory.

- The narrative of the introduction is modified to align with the above changes.

Other major points:
The title already mentions the distances to type Ia supernovae, yet there is no
estimate as to the limiting distance range of this technique. Out to what
horizon could this approach be applied to measure the distance to type Ia
supernovae? (Directly given by the limiting magnitude and angular resolution,
but this should be estimated and quoted.)

######

This information is given in Figure 1: Limiting magnitude and angular resolution as a function of redshift.  

######


What array layout and how many baselines are assumed in the simulations?

######

The array layout and baselines are described in the text after equation 19.

######


You quote a series of papers to support the assumed magnitude 12 limit, however
it is unclear if this is really stated in connection to "a hypothetical array
similar to CTA-MST" somewhere, e.g. [11] corresponds to VLA-type detectors,
whereas the Cherenkov telescope references reach magnitude ~4 at best.

######

We have modified the text and assignment of references.

######


some more minor points:

the limiting magnitude assumed should be mentioned in the abstract along with
the distance horizon

#####

The limiting magnitude is added to the abstract.

#####


L31 "when equipped with can sources" -- when equipped with what? something is
missing.

######

We have added the missing "equipped with appropriate instrumentation" to the text.

######


L36 "patient" not sure what is meant here - "study" perhaps?

######

The text is changed to "patient astronomer" who needs time to develop a significant SN sample.

######


Figure 1: the realistic region in these plots is relatively small, i.e. < 10 in
m_lim and < 2 km baseline.
What is the justification for going as high as 8 km baseline? This has no
relevance to the "hypothetical array similar to the MSTs of CTA-South", which at
most is~ 1km.

######

This article scopes basic requirements for a purpose-built array designed for the science case.  We add text to the introduction to emphasize this.
